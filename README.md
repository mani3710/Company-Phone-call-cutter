In modern mobile applications, managing incoming phone calls efficiently can be crucial for maintaining productivity and focusing on essential tasks. For businesses using React Native, developing a phone call rejecter feature can be highly beneficial, particularly for auto-disconnecting calls from specific numbers, such as those from a company or marketing calls. This functionality ensures that unwanted interruptions are minimized, allowing users to stay focused on their work.

Implementing a phone call rejecter in React Native involves leveraging various APIs and libraries that enable the detection and handling of incoming calls. For example, by integrating React Native modules that interact with native call management features, developers can create a system that automatically rejects calls based on predefined criteria. In this case, the goal is to automatically disconnect calls originating from numbers starting with a specific prefix, such as "+911", which is commonly used by companies for contact purposes.

By setting up a mechanism to identify such numbers and programmatically end the call, users can avoid disruptions caused by unsolicited or non-essential calls. This feature enhances productivity and improves the overall user experience by ensuring that only relevant and important calls are received. With the right approach, a phone call rejecter in React Native can significantly streamline communication management for users.
